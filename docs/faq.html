During your initial contact, we'll gather some basic information about your needs to match you with the most appropriate clinician. New clients typically begin with an initial consultation to discuss concerns, goals, and treatment options. We offer both in-person and telehealth appointments to accommodate different preferences and needs.

                                    Your first appointment, often called an initial consultation, typically lasts about 50-60 minutes. During this session, your psychologist will discuss confidentiality, gather information about your current concerns, relevant history, and goals for therapy. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions about the therapeutic process and approach. Based on this discussion, your psychologist will work with you to develop a preliminary treatment plan and discuss next steps. The initial session is also a chance to ensure you feel comfortable with your therapist and their approach.

                                    Many Irish health insurance providers cover some or all of the costs of sessions with a Chartered Clinical Psychologist. For example, Irish Life covers up to 50% of costs depending on the policy, Laya Healthcare covers 50% of costs for up to 8 sessions annually under certain policies, and HSF Health Plan offers varying levels of reimbursement for clinical psychologist fees. Our team is happy to assist you in navigating your insurance options to ensure you can access support. We recommend contacting your insurance provider directly to verify your specific coverage.

The process typically includes gathering developmental history, current symptoms, and functional impacts across different settings (home, work, or school). Following the assessment, we provide detailed recommendations for managing ADHD and enhancing functioning in daily life. While we provide thorough diagnostic assessments, please note that our psychologists do not prescribe medication but can work collaboratively with medical professionals who do.

                                    The duration of assessments varies depending on the type and complexity. General psychological assessments typically take 1-2 sessions, while comprehensive assessments like ADHD or autism evaluations may require 2-4 sessions to complete. Each session is typically 1-2 hours. Following the assessment sessions, our psychologists need additional time to score measures, analyze results, and prepare comprehensive reports with recommendations. We aim to deliver reports within 2-3 weeks after completing all assessment sessions.

                                    The duration of therapy varies based on individual needs, goals, and the nature of the concerns being addressed. Some clients benefit from brief interventions of 6-8 sessions, while others with more complex issues may engage in therapy for several months. During your initial consultation, we'll discuss treatment recommendations and provide an estimate of the therapeutic timeline. We regularly review progress throughout treatment and adjust our approach as needed.

                                    Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is one of the most widely researched and effective therapeutic approaches. It works by helping clients identify unhelpful thought patterns, challenge them, and replace them with healthier ways of thinking and behaving. CBT is structured and goal-oriented, focusing on the connections between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This approach has proven particularly effective for conditions such as anxiety disorders, depression, PTSD, and OCD. Our clinicians often find CBT particularly effective in treating OCD and related conditions.

                                    Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a structured therapy specifically designed to help individuals process and resolve traumatic memories. It uses bilateral stimulation techniques, such as eye movements, to help clients reprocess distressing experiences in a safe and controlled way. EMDR is particularly effective for trauma-related conditions, including PTSD, phobias, and anxiety disorders. Our clinicians find it especially effective for single-incident traumas, while using a blend of EMDR and other modalities for complex trauma. The therapy not only reduces trauma symptoms but often enhances self-esteem and resilience.
